Since seeing Tron Legacy I've been sort of obsessed with the style of the UI on Flynn's computer. So, I thought - why not try to make my Terminal look as close to that as I can?

Side note: It'd be great if the iPad's UI was theme-able and someone with considerable skills made a Tron Legacy UI but that isn't the world we live in. So, I'm stuck with this.

To do: 
- Find the font used in the screenshot.
